# Scratch

This is just a scratch pad. At the moment I'm using it to test the new Keystone API. To run the test cases, clone this repository in the public/ directory of your KeystoneJS install so that it gets served up as a static asset. Then open the index.html file in a web browser with a JavaScript console.
